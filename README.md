My name is Ian Herbert, I am currently a Web Development student living in Nantes, France.

I work with JS, HTML, CSS, PHP as well as Node.js, and React.

I come from Cleveland, Ohio, and have lived in France since 2017. Before landing in web dev, I completed two degrees from Cleveland State University in French, and in Urban Planning. After finishing my degrees I left the US and worked as a restaurant manager in Paris for several years before leaving la capitale for something a little more humaine in Pays de La Loire.

I'm a big fan of american football (Cleveland Browns) and unironically love Rod Stewart.
